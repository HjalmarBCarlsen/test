### 1. Digital Data and Processual methodology
With the use of high resolution social media data it becomes possible to trace the action of activist on a population level. That is we do not only have pre-selected states such, members of organization or "been at demonstration the last year", we have all the activity which a given user has performed within public spaces on Facebook. How one engages with a issue, what the relevant events are can then to a higher degree be **abductively molded** - constructed in iterations, and clashes between empirical material and theoretical perspectives, a highly needed element for people adhering to **descriptive pluralism**.

Before social media data the actions of activists where hard to capture at a granary scale. You could count demonstrations and survey target population, use membership records, event data form newspapers and gather ethnographic observations. Each of them with their weakness. You had to choose from infering activty from institutional affiliation in one way of the other, or loosing sight of the population level dynamic in order to focus on a few selected activists and even then action would be hard to capture with the suffiencient rigour needed for statistical operations to be worth while(newspaper event analysis is here an possible although not unproblematic exception).

With Facebook data you can ask 1)**when** a user was active, 2)**where** he was active and 3)**how** he was active, with 4)**whom**, with 5)**what** and 6)**why**. Naturally these data sources are not all that great, but the fact that they are there gives rise to new methodological possibilities. These **5W's** of course have a reference to Burkian dramaturgy, which has  been widely refered to within quantitative cultural sociology(see Mohr XXX,XXX,XX), especially advances in content analysis(Mohr XXXX, XXX,XXXX). Importantly digital data such as Facebook allows us to effectively move beyond seeing the 5W has meaning making categories in cultural sense and instead see them as explanations of action in the (positivists) narrative sense(Abbott). Event reporting in newspaper data has been used for the same purpose (Tilly Franzosi aso). But Facebook does not simply report on a tendency without giving us a detailed trace. Where the newspaper article might state that there was a "green activists demonstrated against Big Business", Facebook gives all the people how have left there trace of dissatisfaction, the tendencies and breaks in their engagement can then be used to explain the rise and fall of **public issues**.

1. **When** one gets from the timestamped activity provided by Facebooks API. Are all likes and shares given as timestamped? When of course not only refers to the abstract clock time of an event, but also to this event **position** in sequence order - that is its diacronic or sequential relations.

2. **Where** refers both to the digital object that an actor has commented on and what page this object is on. In a two mode network pages are elements and users subjects, this would give some analytical possibilities.

3. **How** is accessible both through the native categorization of an action within the Facebook universe: A like, a share, a post or a comment. These categories carry useful information Liking, sharing aso are very different forms of social practices,each with their set of possible semantics connected to it. But we need not stick with Facebooks own level of description. We might aggregate it into an overall **level of activity** or code the activity our selfs, either semi automatically through some kind of natural language processing or fully manual by coding each activity. The first NLTK coding might be used to cluster all activity within different **themes** or **issues** when one could use this information to look at **sequence of issue engagement**. The manual coding could be used to develop an typology of activisms on Facebook, the different tactics used in order to provoke an effect: **play, purification, translation, compositing, contextualizing, care, critique, planned engagement** aso

4) **Whom** - we both have all the other activists how are active within the same space and the organisational affiliation of that space - the page.

5) **What** - this points back to how, in that we known the specific digital object that an user has engaged with. We might also create larger classes of categories **themes** or **issues**.


###2. Ideal typical activist careers

When we have the **5W** then one can ask rather interesting sequential questions? One simple set of question is: Do we see distinct clusters of activity pattern? And how do these patterns diverge? And with what consequence for understanding (dis)engagement?

The questions relate to **Whole Sequence Analysis** where one clusters individual sequences according to there similarity(or rather dissimilarity). In this way one gets what Abbott has called general stories - pattern searching through particular sequences. In Abbott's view this is a somewhat thride space between the complex particulars of the historical narrative and the generalist mode of causal sociological inquiry. **Facebook activism** might be analyzed simply in terms of activity: This might result in the following pattern 0-1-0-0-0-1-1-1-4-0, where every position is a day and numerical score is sum of registered actions.

####2.1 Theoretical Perspectives
One could quiet easily couple Thévenot regime of familiarity with Lefebvre cyclical time, routine, organic evolving jet not identical. On the other hand  we have linear planned time, that is identical and follows a mechanical rhythm as opposed to familiarities organic one. What about justification? This might be an event time, that is a critical situation that demands attention so that both personal goals and societal structures(Anne Rawls) are deemed 	irrelevant before the situation is resolved. The event time then is a from of intensity that produces its own space of temporal order. Viewed from the point of view of sequences with which it is related it also has a eventual properties in that it seems to be a rare occasion.

If we think of Thévenots test then we might say that activists adjust their engagement on the bases of *trail and error*. Do they fell at ease with moving around the Facebook page liking this, sharing that and commenting on something else? If we think of everyday activism on Facebook as something we want to feel at easy with then certain sequence might emerge. On the other hand if we think of engagement with green issues as a highly planned activity then others might emerge aso.

 - **Activism - A personal Track**: 1-1-1-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-1-0-0 this sort of sequence is the "getting used to" where the beginning
   has either long pauses or dramatic intensities before finding a
   steady state.

 - **Activism - the professional road**: 0-0-1-1-1-1-1-0-0-1-1-1-1-1 aso, Workday activism, a professional NGO like activity rythme.

 - **Activism - The situation , the public roundabout**: Here it is maybe not so much the sequences of engagement by a given subject,
   as it is the network synchronize, jet non-routinized sequence, where
   a set of actors act on the same element, producing a public(White and
   Dewey AND Marres). The situation temporality

 - **Activism - playing around and exploring new land**: exploration refers to engaging with the unknown, trying out new places aso. In
   sequence terms one might have a activity sequence that has a certain
   Hitchhike quality. So it is a sudden travel to new places, in network
   sequence terms it might be a ego graph visit to places far way form
   his normal where abouts, a bit like the **liveliness score**. We might also expect it might happen i **sessions**, that is we might be able to see that this mode of engagement typically results in multiple actions following from one another.

We might have an idea that an **issue** or **page** for that matter need all three elements in order to ensure sustained activism. If we think of an issue as something both qualified in critical situations, carried by **stakeholders** and cared for by **relatives**, then we can see that all three activity from contribute to sustaining the issue as an 'thing' flowing within the Facebook information infrastructure and as a thing of (multiple) relevancies for the agent which it encounter. The three regimes of engagement might also work against one another, or pressurize one another. For example if a object gets to caught op in a specific regime of engagement that it can't be acted upon without one immediately provokes a certain mode of action. For example the windmill which is by definition an object within either within the plan(denoted positively) or within justification(both positive and negative). This is of course the kind of situation which might have given ground to the antiwindmill activism around the world.

In regards to the theory of (dis)engagement one could have the theory of **robust engagement**, which is one where an activist is engaged in more than one regime. They are familiarly attached to environmental practice, they plan green lives, and they justify and critique on behalf of green beings. That is their public persona, their familiar surroundings and their future plans are all invested in green living..

Could one use Thévenot as resource for explaining (dis)engagement. The normal way to explain disengagement by social attributes, that is making a **social model** that can account for the probability of disengaging without looking into specific event but merely predicting on the *death of engagement*. With Thévenot we might give action, and a plurality of different modes of action, center stage in our analysis of (dis)engagement. With the theoretical arsenal around *engagement*, *environment* and *test* we might see actors interaction with their environment as the "what leads to" (dis)engagement. If we take Gross pragmatic explanatory as our starting point Thévenot has some advantage over Tilly, how Gross regards providing an example of the pragmatic explanations model. Unlike Tilly Thévenot regimes of engagement are bound to an environment and tested in relation here to. So in order to understand shifts in engagement we are to understand the shifts in certain sequences of *tests* and engagements. In the *Parlementarization of Britain* Tilly can't explain the shift in repertoires of constetation merely show that they are there. His explanation can't stay internal to an action based explanation due to him lacking a concept of **cognition** **problem situations** and **tests**, without these he has to leave action and enter into structure.

Med blik for de små handlinger, udforskninger kan vi også se hvordan det ikke blot er folks social attributer der gør folk disponeret til noget også bliver sete aktiveret ved et eksternt event, men snarere noget som har åbnet sig op imod ved nogle små indledende test.

###3. (Inter)cohesion - Gatherings of activists and issues

This analytical perspective draws upon recent advances within relational methods where network methods has been used to produce *interwoven linkages*(Stark & Vedres 2010), which I'll combine with the notion of *gatherings*(Goffman, Latour, Lehmann, Blok et al.), which is a concept and conceptualization of the social form(see Blok et al.) that takes advantage for the high data granularity for the stake of descriptive precision and a possible shift from a network analytic to a situational/eventual outlook.

Stark & Vedres 2010 rethink groupness through the idea of *linages of cohesion*. As they put it: *"Our intuition is that nuclear groups that share an ancestry might stay close to one another, connected by the intercohesive sharing of members and a common, repeatedly interwoven line of descent"*(ibid: 1160). This familiarity, they claim, could facilitate the emergency of *structural folds*, due to an easy in group coordination - based on the idea that people who share a common ancestry are less lightly to have radically different habits of action thereby reducing the costs of structural folds. These *linages of cohesion* constitutes a historical-sociological object where one turns from a sole focus on the group to one on the *kinship structures* of, in their case, business organization.

#### 2.1 **Methods**

A youtube introduction to CPM is found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIS5pZ8doH8). [CPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_percolation_method) finds all cliques and given a certain dissimilarity threshold k-1 is they one they use so that two clique are a part of the same **union** if they share all but one node. Cliques are fully connected subcomponent. What they do is then take all clique unions at each year and if two member from a clique at time 1 is present at a clique at time 2 then they get an edge between them.

Stark & Vedres sees this nonrandom tendency for regroup over time as prove of the easy of coordination when group members share a common ancestry. An easy way to convert this perspective to Facebook engagement is to look for posts where more than 2 actives are active on the same post. Their engagement in the same post over time need not only be due to enhanced coordination, but also due a shared objects of concern. That is they have invested in the same set of objects. That being said Facebooks information infrastructure creates a informational bond between actors if they act on the same digital object, so their historical interaction enhances the possibility of reviving information on one another's activity.

One interesting question could be: do we see distinct cluster/path through the political landscape? Are these paths issue specific or organization specific or maybe a mixture? Is it possible to locate certain points of centrality, where suddenly all activity is on a few number of posts? And following on from this is it possible to locate changes in the flow of activity?












One major difference from my approach to network sequence and that of many others is that instead of giving the network structure it theoretical context within a set of variables, I seek to locate event through network sequences. And then zoom in on these in order to tell the story of a major and vast political landscapes(landslides) by the iterative movements between the thin view of scattered (inter)action and the think description of turning points. These iteration have the challenge of creating couplings between the thin and thick between events where there plausibly can be one observation to the event. In this case of activism on Facebook we might locate highly synchronized jet non-routinized engagement that seems to provoke radical changes in the overall patterns. One important element is here that we need not assume an romantic idea of the event as that which has no roots, a nearly magical contingency which changes all there is, external to structure in Sewell terms(ref). We might easily locate the actors how have invested both time and sacrificed 'other futures', their specific handles on reality and how these gained momentum op to the event. The move is then locate turning point backtrack the relevant sequences of action leading up to a *turning points*. With highly detailed processual data these movements are not impossible at all. Hopefully the extra ordinary and ordinary, the mundane everyday like and exceptional event might enter into a more realistic relationship - we might speak of continuum or even a enveloping of *displacements* and *in-placements*.

####From Groups over Networks to Gatherings - Towards an eventful methodology

The idea is simple: the gathering should take center stage as the **social form** that stirs our analysis. Now of course an gathering is positioned in constraining and enabling ways, in space as related to others and in time as something following a sequence of action and followed by a sequence of action. Importantly though is that gathering retain the ability to produce social effect which are not the result of network nor sequence structure. In this sense gathering are *eventfull*.












**Turning points** might be identified both as a result of the inherent sequential pattern or as the consequence of an specific event(in time and space). The former located by the subsequences leading up to a change; the latter located byø looking across individual sequences to see if a change occurred in multiple sequences at the same time. Which measures



Intro and question?
Exploiting social media datas rich relational features this articles analysis both typical trajectories of
green activism and typical turningpoints within an activist career. The article seeks to answer both the patterns of activity leading to different faith in ones engagement activity? And more specifically
to the patterns of engagement varying from highly stable to relatively random forms of engagement. Lastly the analysis looks into the charateristics of events that constitut turningpoints for activists engagement.
